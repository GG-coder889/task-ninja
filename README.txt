Task Queue:

Existing tasks can be added to the task queue through either queuing or the task queue selector.  New tasks can be added directly 	to the task queue.  "Deleting" tasks from the task queue only removes the task from the queue and does not actually delete the 	task.  The first uncompleted task on the task queue will appear on the task queue widget.

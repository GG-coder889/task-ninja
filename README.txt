Task Queue:

Existing tasks can be added to the task queue through either queuing or the task queue selector.  New tasks can be added directly 	to the task queue.  "Deleting" tasks from the task queue only removes the task from the queue and does not actually delete the 	task.  The first uncompleted task on the task queue will appear on the task queue widget.


Queue Selector:

All selected tasks on the queue selector are added to the task queue.  Tasks selected here that are not already on the queue will be added to the end of the queue.


Queue Widget:

The queue widget displays the first uncompleted task on the task queue.  Clicking on the queue widget completes the task.


Queuing:

Through the queuing function of task settings, which can be found be clicking on the more button of a task, tasks can be added to either the front or the back of the queue at the specified time(s).
